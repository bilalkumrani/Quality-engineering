Quality is stand alone word

 - it is implicit (if we want to refer to bad we shoul explicitly say bad quality)
 - Highly subjective term (everyone has its own defination)
 - it is dynamic (evolves with respect to time, defination can be changed according to product)
 
 -> A degree to which a set of inherent characterstics fullfil requirments is called quality.
 
 Degree:
 Quality is continum begining with 0 and moving towards infinity.
 
 Characterstics:
 capablity of deliverable or robustness of a product.
 
 Requirments:
 (i) stated by a customer in a made to order scenario.
 (ii) by product specification in comercial of the shelf scenario.

 Different perspectives to see quality
 1- Customer
 	product:
 	(defect free, reliable, easy to use, fault tolerance, safe)
 	service:
 	(easy to obtain, pleasent service)
 
 2- Producers
 	product:
 	(product should fullfil specification of user)
 	service:
 	(meet deadline, deliverd on time)
 
 
 3- Govt
 	product:
	(safety, insurance)

 
 4- Industry association
 	Product:
 	(industry reputation, protecting from frauds, address queries of consumer and govts)
 	
 	
 	
Specification:
details on which we are going to develop product

Explicit specification:
		service provider selects some specification and give to user.

Implicit specification:
		Those specification which are important already understood things by common sense.
		
		

some specifications are industry standards which often govts and iso IEEE orgs define.

These minumum things should be provided to users:
- use of product
- limitations of product
- process by which product is made
- security and safety 


Provider must consider these things:
- define specification if not available.
- complete the best specification that we defined.
- ensure specifications.
- Now make this product available to the customers.

Quality and reliablity:

Reliablity:
capablity to function at the defined level of performance for the duration of its life.
(we have to define what should be the level of performance, normal or peak performance)

Duration of life of software:
	 - Initial life: (till product's waranty)
	 - Operating life: (with maintenance)
	 
Reliablity also known as mean time between failures and mean time to repair.

concept of wear and tear becomes the part of software because of change in configurations
of software during its life, because of config errors arise and software can tear.
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Evolution of quality:

initialy we just consider state of product as a quality but after inspection phase introduced which
insures the quality of the product.
started taking feedback.

(quality control circles introduced, 0 defects products made, right first time)

Quality Gurus

William Edwards Deming - (Quality Guru) :
He said if organization will focus on quality then quality will increased but cost will fall.
if we increase quality we will have to compromise on budgetS.

14 points:

1- contancy of purpose (Purpose should be same)
2- Adopt new philosophy
3- Statistical inferencing (quality calculation should be statistical)
4- Price ( there should be balance bw price and quality)
5- Improve continously (find problems and solve them)
6- on the job training (give learning oportunities to employees)
7- supervision (leadership instead of supervision)
8- Fear should not be motivation of workers
9- Less bariers
10- Methods Use of good methods for development to get good results
11- Eleminate qouta.
12- Pride and appriciate workers
13- Retraining and education (educate to increase sense of responsiblity and ownership of workers)
14- Management to implement these points

Remember:
(CISMM) contancy, Improve, Methods, Management


Four bariers which can stop business from success (Deming)
1- Neglecting long term planning
2- Relying on technology to solve problem
3- seeking proven methods rather developing new one
4- Hiding behind the excuse that our problems are different



Business success cycle (Deming)

1- Plan the action
2- Do caryout the plan
3- Check the results of actions
4- Act (what modifications are needed)

Remember:
(PDCA)


 

Joseph Moses Juran – Quality Guru

he said:

there are three things in quality:

1- Quality planning
	identify customers and their needs
	optimise product
	specification should be upto date and dsign should be good
2- Quality Improvement
	define a process that produce a product
3- Quality control
	Test and proof that process we selected can give us quality product
	then implement that process




Philip Bayard Crosby – (Quality Guru) 
 
 he says: 
 Do it right in first time
 And there should be zero defects
 
 Four principles of quality by croby
 
 1- if product fullfils the requirment then it is quality product
 2- prevention during the process of product development
 3- performance standard product should meet it completely
 4- 
 
 
 Five points of business success (crosby)
 
 1- people do things right in first time
 2- use change as a advantage of organization
 3- consistent growth
 4- new products should developed when necesary
 5- every one shoul work hapily in organisation
