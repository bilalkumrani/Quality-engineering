Quality is stand alone word

 - it is implicit (if we want to refer to bad we have to explicitly say bad quality)
 - Highly subjective term (everyone has its own defination)
 - it is dynamic (evolves with respect to time, defination can be changed according to product)
 
 -> A degree to which a set of inherent characterstics fullfil requirments is called quality.
 
 Degree:
 Quality is continum begining with 0 and moving towards infinity.
 
 Characterstics:
 capablity of deliverable or robustness of a product.
 
 Requirments:
 (i) stated by a customer in a made to order scenario.
 (ii) by product specification in comercial of the shelf scenario.

 Different perspectives to see quality
 1- Customer
 	product:
 	(defect free, reliable, easy to use, fault tolerance, safe)
 	service:
 	(easy to obtain, pleasent service)
 
 2- Producers
 	product:
 	(product should fullfil specification of user)
 	service:
 	(meet deadline, deliverd on time)
 
 
 3- Govt
 	product:
	(safety, insurance)

 
 4- Industry association
 	Product:
 	(industry reputation, protecting from frauds, address queries of consumer and govts)
 	
 	
 	
Specification:
details on which we are going to develop product

Explicit specification:
		service provider selects some specification and give to user.

Implicit specification:
		Those specification which are important already understood things by common sense.
		
		

some specifications are industry standards which often govts and iso IEEE orgs define.

These minumum things should be provided to users:
- use of product
- limitations of product
- process by which product is made
- security and safety 


Provider must consider these things:
- define specification if not available.
- complete the best specification that we defined.
- ensure specifications.
- Now make this product available to the customers.

Quality and reliablity:

Reliablity:
capablity to function at the defined level of performance for the duration of its life.
(we have to define what should be the level of performance, normal or peak performance)

Duration of life of software:
	 - Initial life: (till product's waranty)
	 - Operating life: (with maintenance)
	 
Reliablity also known as mean time between failures and mean time to repair.

concept of wear and tear becomes the part of software because of change in configurations
of software during its life, because of config errors arise and software can tear.
__________________________________________________________________________________________

Evolution of quality:

initialy we just consider state of product as a quality but after inspection phase introduced which
insures the quality of the product.
started taking feedback.

(quality control circles introduced, 0 defects products made, right first time)

Quality Gurus

William Edwards Deming - (Quality Guru) :
He said if organization will focus on quality then quality will increased but cost will fall.
if we increase quality we will have to compromise on budgetS.

14 points:

1- contancy of purpose (Purpose should be same)
2- Adopt new philosophy
3- Statistical inferencing (quality calculation should be statistical)
4- Price ( there should be balance bw price and quality)
5- Improve continously (find problems and solve them)
6- on the job training (give learning oportunities to employees)
7- supervision (leadership instead of supervision)
8- Fear should not be motivation of workers
9- Less bariers
10- Methods Use of good methods for development to get good results
11- Eleminate qouta.
12- Pride and appriciate workers
13- Retraining and education (educate to increase sense of responsiblity and ownership of workers)
14- Management to implement these points

Remember:
(CISMM) contancy, Improve, Methods, Management


Four bariers which can stop business from success (Deming)
1- Neglecting long term planning
2- Relying on technology to solve problem
3- seeking proven methods rather developing new one
4- Hiding behind the excuse that our problems are different



Business success cycle (Deming)

1- Plan the action
2- Do caryout the plan
3- Check the results of actions
4- Act (what modifications are needed)

Remember:
(PDCA)


 

Joseph Moses Juran – Quality Guru

he said:

there are three things in quality:

1- Quality planning
	identify customers and their needs
	optimise product
	specification should be upto date and dsign should be good
2- Quality Improvement
	define a process that produce a product
3- Quality control
	Test and proof that process we selected can give us quality product
	then implement that process




Philip Bayard Crosby – (Quality Guru) 
 
 he says: 
 Do it right in first time
 And there should be zero defects
 
 Four principles of quality by crosby
 
 1- if product fullfils the requirment then it is quality product
 2- prevention during the process of product development
 3- performance standard product should meet it completely
 4- 
 
 
 Five points of business success (crosby)
 
 1- people do things right in first time
 2- use change as a advantage of organization
 3- consistent growth
 4- new products should developed when necesary
 5- every one should work hapily in organisation
 
 __________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 Total quality management - TQM
 
 This is the concept which is being used worldwide
 
 It is a management approach for an organization centered on quality, central focus is quality
 all members of organization should participate in tasks no one is neglect and aim for long term 
 success through customer satisfaction and benefit to all members of the organization and to society.
 - Focus on continous process improvement
 - Organization process should be visible, rpeatable and measurable.
 - We believe products will function as they are designed to function.
 - Study the way a user uses a product.
 - Should provide aesthetic value alognwith usablity.

Are We giving Adequate Importance to Quality in Organizations?

- Poor quality means decline in business
- Quality function is like audit function in the finance department
- External audit is compulsory in many countries
- Quality departments with no or low authority in organizations
- Shareholders’ money VS consumers’ interests
	usualy departments don't expose poor quality because stackholder invested money in that
	product, we must give importance to consumer's interests(money, safety, time of consumer is on
	risk)
- CMMI and ISO do not mandate a quality department

 	Orgnizational and Quality goals
 	
 	
 
 Organizational Goals --> important
 
 - Strategic goals
 	strategy for survival
 	strategy for growth
 	
 - Financial goals
 	generate desired revenue
 
 - Marketting
 	Networking
 	How many people really know us
 	What is our customer support
 	
 - Product
 	on what will we working in coming time
 	Innovation?
 	Quality?
 	Reliablity?
 	Delivery on time?
 	
 - Human resources
 	staff retention?
 	
 	
 	
 Remember (SHFMP)-->(strategy, HR, finance, marketting, product)
 
 
 
 Quality goals --> important
 
 
 - Achieve and surpass industry benchmarks for product quality
 - Achieve and surpass industry benchmarks for product reliability
 - Instead of time spent on inspection, Improve the development process (prevention approach)
 - Archive good quality in reduced cost
 - Low defect rate
 
 
 __________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 	Is a Quality Department in Software Development Organizations Really Needed?
 
 - Continuous implementation of quality assurance activities would be ensured, without exception( QA activities will not be missed in any batch)
 
 - Continious monetring of quality
 - organization archiving its quality objectives or not (implement effort if needed to archive)
 - we will become the benchmark for peer organizations
 - Expert support and training on how to achieve quality objectives would be provided to technical teams
 - A repository for quality data generated by the organization would be made available to those who need it
 - Defect analysis would be carried out and elimination of the top causes of defects would be facilitated
 -A “watchdog,” “in-house customer representative,” and “eyes and ears” of management in matters of product and deliverable quality of the organization would exist, raising its voice when quality trends show a downturn
 
 
 __________________________________________________________________________________________
 
 		Software quality assurance activites
- Defect prevention

- Defect identification

- Defect removal

- Defect contentment:
	To catch and fix defects before they escape into later phases.

 
 Remember (PIRC)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Characterstics of quality software:
- maintainability
- correctness
- reusability
- reliability
- portability
- efficiency.
